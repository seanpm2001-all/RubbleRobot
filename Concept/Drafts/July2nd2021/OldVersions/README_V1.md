# RubbleBot

## Name choices (early)

1. RubbleGigaBot

2. RubbleTeraBot

3. RubbleBot

4. Debris10000

## Purpose

A giant bot with the aim of rescue missions

## Goal 

To safely move a minimum of 10 tons of debris per hour, a minimum of 240 tons per day. For quickly finding survivors of building collapses of all sizes.

## Inspire by

the efforts of rescuing people in the Miami Dade county, Surfside Florida building collapse (June 2021) and the needs of improvement for similar issues. Although not 100% effective against saving all lives, it can help save the possible survivors. Don't rely on this bot directly, please inspect your buildings and evacuate them when they are deemed unsafe, don't be a complete idiot and wait 3 years to even start repairs to result in over a dozen people dying, and a nationwide issue for over a week.

## Features

1. Giant storage container, capable of holding 200 tons of debris, should be constantly cleared out, depending on how many tons the structure was, and how fast you can get it out

2. Octo-hand mechanism - A set of 256 giant gentle mechanical arms that can pick up debris quickly and safely, without affecting people. The number of hands is customizable, but I chose a squared number, as it is a common one to go with, and enough to pick up lots of debris simultaneously. How the arms are connected and move around is the difficult part. It also may be a problem differentiating humans from debris, so heat sensing and other sensing will be needed.

## Problems

1. This project still needs a ton of programming work (I have not had a successful big robot yet)

2. I do not have access to a $40M+ machine that can do this, so programming work will be done without testing for now.
