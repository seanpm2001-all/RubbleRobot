# Name tests

This is a list of the various name tests I went through while making the first draft of the concept, as I need a name to publish the project.

## Too generic

1. RubbleGigaBot

2. RubbleTeraBot

3. RubbleBot

4. Debris10000

## Too ambitious

1. RubulousMiracle

2. Miracle (it is too ambitious to call it a miracle on its first draft, and I want to reserve miracle for a much more helpful project.)

## Too common (phonetics)

1. Rubot (Pronounced Ru bot, Ru as in Russian)

## What I went with

It is generic, but I have to go with it, as the name isn't the most important part, and I spent too much time on the name and need to go with the project

This is what I went with in the meantime.
